# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: Looking at the implementation of the tesselation given in a lab, I should have utilized more helper functions.
Mine used the bottom-left corner and slowly went up and to the right, tesselating.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: A hexagon may be a room, and the tesselation is the placement of the rooms for the project 3 side

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I think I might make a method that would create a line or a rectangle to simplify the process
of making the world.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**
